Iteration 1 – Interface Improvements

The first iteration focused on making the game feel more personal and informative for the player.

Features Added

Player Name Input
The player can enter their name, which is shown above their board during the game.

Player Stats Panel
A stats panel was added to show:

Total shots fired
Total hits
Total misses
Accuracy percentage

These features only affect the display and do not change how the game works internally.

Iteration 2 – Gameplay Feature

The second iteration added a simple power-up to make the game more interesting.

Features Added

Double Shot Power-Up
The player can use a Double Shot once per game to fire two shots in a single turn.

The computer still only takes one shot.

The power-up becomes disabled after it is used.

This feature required managing turn flow to keep the game fair.

Known Limitations

The computer opponent uses a basic random strategy.

Player stats reset when a new game starts.

There is no multiplayer or save functionality.
